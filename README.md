# Decision Tree Classifier for Social Media Post Likelihood Prediction

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating the use of a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting the likelihood of a social media post receiving a like based on various features.

## Overview

The provided script utilizes the scikit-learn library to create and visualize a decision tree classifier. The classifier is trained on a dataset consisting of features such as content type, posting time, and previous interaction with the poster, with the target variable being whether the post received a like or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
   
1. Clone this repository or copy the script to your local environment.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Assignment
Objective: To predict snack choices using a Decision Tree Classifier.

1. Setup: Import matplotlib.pyplot, DecisionTreeClassifier, and plot_tree.

2. Data Creation: Encode snack preferences into a numerical dataset.

3. Training: Train a DecisionTreeClassifier with your dataset.

4. Visualization: Use plot_tree to visualize the decision tree.

5. Prediction: Predict a snack choice for a new set of features.

6. Display: Map the prediction to a snack name and show it.

7. Conclusion: Analyze the prediction and consider how feature changes affect the outcome.
