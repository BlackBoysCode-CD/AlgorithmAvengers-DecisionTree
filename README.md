# Decision Tree Classifier for Social Media Post Likelihood Prediction

This repository contains a Python script demonstrating the use of a Decision Tree Classifier for predicting the likelihood of a social media post receiving a like based on various features.

## Overview

The provided script utilizes the scikit-learn library to create and visualize a decision tree classifier. The classifier is trained on a dataset consisting of features such as content type, posting time, and previous interaction with the poster, with the target variable being whether the post received a like or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
